**CellAtria** is an intelligent, agent-driven platform for automating the end-to-end ingestion, preparation, and analysis of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) datasets. It integrates large language models (LLMs) with domain-specific computational toolchains to streamline single-cell workflows - from literature parsing and metadata extraction to data acquisition and pipeline execution - via a natural language interface.

## üìå Key Features
<details>

- Accepts a **URL** or **PDF** of a primary article.
- Extracts structured metadata (e.g., sample annotations, GEO accessions) from manuscripts.
- Supports **GSE-level (study-wide)** and **GSM-level (sample-specific)** retrieval from public repositories.
- Automatically resolves GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) relationships and organizes files in compliant directory schemas.
- Executes the co-developed **CellExpress** pipeline - an end-to-end, containerized scRNA-seq analysis framework.
- Offers fine-grained control over tool behavior through structured dialogue.
- Tools are embedded as graph nodes and accessed via natural language.
- Supports metadata inspection, file downloads, directory traversal, report summarization, and more.

## üìò Getting Started
<details>

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites

- **Docker**: Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and ensure the Docker daemon is running.
- **Data Directory**: Prepare a local directory serving as your working directory. 
- **Environment File (`.env`)**: Create a valid `.env` configuration file with required paths and keys. See the [Environment File Setup](#env-setup) section for details on required variables and example templates.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Docker Images

The pre-built images are available in the Docker Hub repository. They can be seamlessly pulled by:

```
docker pull nimanouri/cellatria
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£  Launch CellAtria via Docker

Run the following command in your terminal (replace `/path/to/your/project/directory` and `/path/to/your/env/directory` with your actual directories):

```bash
docker run --platform=linux/amd64 -it --rm \
  -p 7860:7860 \
  -v /path/to/your/project/directory:/data \
  -v /path/to/your/env/directory:/envdir \
  cellatria:v1.0.0 cellatria --env_path /envdir
```

**Command Breakdown:**
- `-p 7860:7860` maps the app port to your host.
- `-v /path/to/your/project/directory:/data` mounts your project directory as `/data` in the container.
- `-v /path/to/your/env/directory:/envdir` mounts your environment directory (with `.env`) as `/envdir`.
- `cellatria --env_path /envdir` launches the agent with your environment directory.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment File Setup

<details>

Before running CellAtria, you must provide a `.env` file containing your configuration and API keys.  
This file tells CellAtria which LLM provider to use and how to connect to it.

- **Download the `.env` template:**  
  [CellAtria .env Template](./path/to/your/env_template.env)  
  *(Replace with the actual path or link to your template file in the repository)*

### Compatible LLM Providers

CellAtria supports seamless integration with the following large language model (LLM) providers:

- **Azure OpenAI**  
  Use enterprise-grade Azure OpenAI endpoints for secure, scalable access to GPT models.
- **OpenAI**  
  Connect directly to OpenAI‚Äôs public API for models like GPT-4 and GPT-3.5.
- **Anthropic**  
  Leverage Claude models via the Anthropic API.
- **Google Gemini / Vertex AI**  
  Access Google‚Äôs Gemini models through the Google Cloud API.
- **Local**  
  Run local models (e.g., Llama.cpp, Ollama, Hugging Face) for private, offline inference.

> **Note:**  
> Only one provider can be active at a time. Set the `PROVIDER` variable in your `.env` to your desired backend.

---

### Instructions

1. **Download or copy** the `.env` template from the link above into your environment directory (e.g., `/envdir/.env`).
2. **Set** the `PROVIDER` variable to match your desired LLM backend (see list above).
3. **Fill in** the required fields for your chosen provider (see comments in the template).
4. **Keep your API keys secure**‚Äîdo not share your `.env` file publicly.

> **Tip:**  
> You only need to fill in the section for your selected provider.

For more details on each provider‚Äôs configuration, see the [Configuration Guide](#configuration-guide).
