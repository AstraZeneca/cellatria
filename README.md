**CellAtria** is an intelligent, agent-driven platform for automating the end-to-end ingestion, preparation, and analysis of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) datasets. It integrates large language models (LLMs) with domain-specific computational toolchains to streamline single-cell workflows - from literature parsing and metadata extraction to data acquisition and pipeline execution - via a natural language interface.

## üìå Key Features
<details>

### üîç Literature-Guided Initialization
- Accepts a **URL** or **PDF** of a primary article.
- Extracts structured metadata (e.g., sample annotations, GEO accessions) from manuscripts.
- Enables **zero-shot** dataset discovery and processing through document parsing.

### üìÇ Metadata-Aware Data Acquisition
- Supports **GSE-level (study-wide)** and **GSM-level (sample-specific)** retrieval from public repositories.
- Automatically resolves GEO relationships and organizes files in compliant directory schemas.
- Prepares `metadata.csv` aligned with pipeline requirements.

### üß¨ Integrated Analysis with CellExpress
- Executes the co-developed **CellExpress** pipeline‚Äîan end-to-end, containerized scRNA-seq analysis framework.
- Performs normalization, HVG selection, batch correction, clustering, marker gene detection, and cell type annotation.
- Supports tissue-agnostic (SCimilarity) and tissue-specific (CellTypist) annotations.

### üß† Conversational Workflow Orchestration
- Facilitates **multi-turn, context-aware reasoning** to walk users through dataset processing.
- Automatically executes validated commands, logging each step for reproducibility.
- Offers fine-grained control over tool behavior through structured dialogue.

### üîß Tool-Driven Modular Architecture
- Tools are embedded as graph nodes and accessed via natural language.
- Supports metadata inspection, file downloads, directory traversal, report summarization, and more.
- Agent actions are both **traceable** and **auditable**, supporting regulatory workflows.

## üìò Getting Started
<details>

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/cellatria.git
cd cellatria

# Launch the agent (with LangGraph or Gradio UI)
python -m cellatria.app
```
To invoke the CLI-based CellExpress pipeline:

```bash
python -m cellexpress.main --input ./data --species human --batch_correct harmony --annotate scimilarity
```
